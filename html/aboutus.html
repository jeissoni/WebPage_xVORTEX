        <h2>In the midst of this new Crypto era</h2>
        <p>surrounded by all kinds of new and exciting projects that promise to open
          new and unexplored possibilities for the market itself and its participants, the focus most of the time
          tends to gravitate towards inside investment but, what about the outside? If we can invest our crypto in
          projects that improve the field by working from the inside of it, can we not also invest in the already
          established marked that runs almost every country and, in that way, improve the field from the outside
          while also making some money in the process? Those were the questions that gave birth to the unique and
          ambitious project called.

        <h2>The <span>XVORTEX ventures</span></h2>
        <p>is a DeFi protocol built on the Ethereum chain that aims to
          generate profit for all of its
          supporters using a unique mixed investment strategy supervised by a governability system. The idea was
          born in late August of 2020 inside the mind of our CEO and Crypto OG Julian Romero who, with the help of
          his wife and current COO of the company Maria Gonzalez developed the idea and established
          the company from scratch on early September of the same year with the incorporation of our CTO Jeisson
          Niño. Since then, our team has grown and now encompasses a considerable number of professional eager to
          see this project thrive.
